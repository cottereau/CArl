CArl

PRESENTATION
============
This project is focused on the development of a software based on the Arlequin multi-model coupling method. The main interest of this software is to allow, by its specific structure, the easy interfacing of different third-party softwares (developed and maintained outside of this project), and adapted to each of the models appearing in the coupling.
 
Two scientific references for the theory are (the second paper is concerned only with the stochastic coupling)

This software is mainly developed at laboratoire MSSMat (Ecole Centrale Paris - CNRS).

It is developed for MATLAB, with some routines directly in C++. This may however evolve in future versions.

INSTALLATION
============
Before using the software, you should make sure that you update the matlab path with the appropriate directories. In matlab, run
>> addpath( genpath('install_dir_CArl/'));
where you replace install_dir_CArl by the full path to the directory CArl/

Additionally, you might want to write this line in the startup file (generally located in ~/matlab/startup.m)

This code has not been extensively tested, but should run on Matlab versions R2007a and newer.

USE
============
The main calling routine is CArl.m

Some examples (in 1D and 2D) can be launched through use of the routine Test.m (see the corresponding help). The tests should run without any problem on computers with around 2Go.
