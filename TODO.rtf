\f0\fs24 \cf0 TODO list:\
\
-  update all the TriRep and DelaunayTri calls to triangulation and delaunayTriangulation\
\
- change the name and calls to 'FE2D' into 'elastic2D' or something similar \'85 in order to stress the difference with HomeFE which is acoustic\
\
- in README, make a list of the codes (with links to webpages, etc ..) that are linked through CArl\
\
- clarify the definition of the alphas in StiffnessMatrix.m there seems to be a lot of repeated stuff between the different cases\
\
- beams are now defined only along x, as 1D problems \'85 this should be made more general}
