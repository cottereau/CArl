###   
#     The file "test_brick_mask.msh" contains a "mask" that identifies, in the 
#   full coupled model domain, the regions with:
#
#   - only one of the models
#   - the coupling area
#   - both models, but outside the coupling area
#
#     This file contains the physical indexes identifying each of these domains, and the 
#   weights associated to them.
###

# Only the "macro" model
MacroDomainOnlyIdx 69

# Only the "micro" model
MicroDomainOnlyIdx 67

# Coupling area
CouplingDomainIdx 68

# Weight of the macro model at the coupling region
# [ micro weight ] = 1 - [ macro weight ]
