\mainpage Presentation

This project is focused on the development of a software based on the [Arlequin multi-model coupling method](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045782508003630). The main interest of this software is to allow, by its specific structure, the easy interfacing of different third-party softwares (developed and maintained outside of this project), and adapted to each of the models appearing in the coupling. Currently, this project includes two implementations of the CArl sofware:

1. a [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.fr/products/matlab/) implementation. 
2. a parallel C++ / MPI implementation, based on [libMesh](https://libmesh.github.io) and [CGAL](http://www.cgal.org). For this part, three solvers are developed: 
- For a static case: a solver CArl-Static(\ref cpp_static) for the stationary solution of coupled system
- For a transit case:  a  solver CArl-Dynamic(\ref cpp_dynamic) for a series of time dependent solution

Most of this documentation covers the C++ implementation. Other than the documentation pages of the code itself, it contains the following sections:

- \ref matlab_main
- \ref cpp_main
  + \ref cpp_installation
  + \ref cpp_static
    + \ref cpp_static_usage 
    + \ref cpp_static_examples
  + \ref cpp_dynamic
    + \ref cpp_dynamic_usage  
    + \ref cpp_dynamic_examples
- \ref articles
- \ref carl_funding

This software is mainly developed at the laboratory [LMPS (Laboratoire MÃ©canique de Paris-Saclay)](https://lmps.ens-paris-saclay.fr/en).
