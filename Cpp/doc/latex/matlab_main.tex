The M\+A\+T\+L\+A\+B implementation of the C\+Arl software can be found at the directory {\ttfamily M\+A\+T\+L\+A\+B}. Currently, the software to which it is interfaced includes \+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item a 1\+D/2\+D F\+E\+M acoustic code,
\item a Timoschenko beam code,
\item an elastic code, and
\item Comsol (\href{http://www.comsol.com}{\tt http\+://www.\+comsol.\+com}).

Before using the software, you should make sure that you update the matlab path with the appropriate directories. In matlab, run `$>$$>$ addpath( genpath(\textquotesingle{}install\+\_\+dir\+\_\+\+C\+Arl/\textquotesingle{}));{\ttfamily  where you replace}install\+\_\+dir\+\_\+\+C\+Arl{\ttfamily by the full path to the directory}C\+Arl/`

Additionally, you might want to write this line in the startup file (generally located in {\ttfamily $\sim$/matlab/startup.m})

This code has not been extensively tested, but should run on Matlab versions R2013a and newer (mainly because the objects triangulation and delaunay\+Triangulation are required)

To use the option {\bfseries F\+E2\+D} (optional), one should install and make available in the path the functions downloadable at \href{http://www.mathworks.in/matlabcentral/fileexchange/27826-fast-assembly-of-stiffness-and-matrices-in-finite-element-method}{\tt http\+://www.\+mathworks.\+in/matlabcentral/fileexchange/27826-\/fast-\/assembly-\/of-\/stiffness-\/and-\/matrices-\/in-\/finite-\/element-\/method} (by Talal Rahman and Jan Valdman)

To use the option {\bfseries beam} (optional), one should install and make available in the path the functions downloadable at \href{https://github.com/wme7/aero-matlab/tree/master/FEM/Timoshenko_beam}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/wme7/aero-\/matlab/tree/master/\+F\+E\+M/\+Timoshenko\+\_\+beam} (by Manuel Diaz and A Ferreira)

To use the option {\bfseries Comsol} (optional), one should install and make available in the path C\+O\+M\+S\+O\+L Multiphysics (see \href{http://www.comsol.com/}{\tt http\+://www.\+comsol.\+com/})

\section*{U\+S\+E}

The main calling routine is {\ttfamily C\+Arl.\+m}

Some examples (in 1\+D and 2\+D) can be launched through use of the routine {\ttfamily Test.\+m} (see the corresponding help). The tests should run without any problem on computers with around 2\+Go.
