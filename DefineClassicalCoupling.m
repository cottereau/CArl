function c = DefineClassicalCoupling( c, m1 )
% DEFINECLASSICALCOUPLING to help in the definition of the coupling
% operator
%  syntax: cout = DefineClassicalCoupling( cin )
%  
%  cin : structured array containing the description of the coupling, with
%        the fields
%       -'type' : either 'zoom' or 'join'
%       -'models' : 1*2 vector naming the models to be coupled (the number
%                  k indicates model{k}). When 'zoom' is used, the first
%                  model of this vector should be the coarse one.
%       -'mediator' : structured array for the definition of the mediator 
%                  space. The fields are
%             --'type': 'deterministic' or 'stochastic' ('deterministic by
%                     default)
%             --'support': 1 or 2. indicates which model should be used as
%                     the support for the physical basis functions. Note
%                     that usually the coarser support should be used.
%       -'operator' : type of coupling operator used ('H1' or 'L2').
%       -'LevelSet1'; 'LevelSet2' : definition of level-sets bounding the
%             coupling zone, given as a mesh in (X,T) format, with the
%             appropriate dimension
%       -'epsilon' : residual value of the non-proeminent model
%
%  cout : same as cin, with the following additional fields
%       -'weight1': structured array defining the relevant information for
%                 model{coupling.models(1)} and containing the fields
%            --'ext': external geometrical limit of the coupling zone given 
%                 as a mesh in (X,T) format, with the appropriate dimension
%            --'int': internal geometrical limit of the coupling zone given
%                 in the same format as ext. The curve int should be 
%                 located inside the curve ext.
%              NB: in 1D, the level sets should include +/-Inf to give
%              sense to 'interior' and 'exterior' definitions
%            --'value': value of the weight function inside the coupling
%                       zone, given as a vector of coefficients of a
%                       polynomial (a scalar for a constant weight, a 2*1
%                       vector for a linear weight, etc ...)
%            --'extvalue': value of the weight outside the exterior curve
%            --'intvalue': value of the weight inside the interior curve
%       -'weight2': same as 'weight1' for the other model. When not
%                   defined, weight2=weight1, except for the values that
%                   are taken such that (value2+value1=1), and int and ext
%                   that are inversed.
